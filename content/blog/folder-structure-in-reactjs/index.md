For the longest time, structuring files and folders in my react application has always been my greatest concerns and the activity that takes away most of my time during development.

File structuring has always been and will always be a very opinionated thing in development, however some level of guidance could help in deciding what works best for you.

This post is just basically a quick shoutout of the amazing article I read written by [robinwieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure/) which he gives a detailed process of how he goes about structuring files and folders from a small scale project all the way to a large scale.

Mind you, his solution isnâ€™t the only way of going about it, but it is by far the most comprehensive and practical guide I have found on this topic.

Hope it helps.
